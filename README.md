## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:Abhi0049k/ready-lock-9044.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd ready-lock-9044
```

Then go to backend folder
```bash
  cd backend 
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```

Now, open a new terminal window or tab to continue with the frontend part.

Navigate to the 'frontend' folder: 

```bash
  cd ../frontend
```

In the 'frontend' folder, locate the files containing links that need to be updated.

Replace the existing links with localhost links, taking care to update the appropriate URLs.

Once you've updated the links, save the files.

Now you're ready to test the application locally with the updated links.


** Please note that when you switch back to the 'frontend' folder to update the links, you need to ensure that you're using the correct URLs for the local development server.**
